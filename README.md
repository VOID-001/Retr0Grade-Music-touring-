Retr0Grade Music Touring Database Management System
Introduction
Retr0Grade Music Touring Database Management System (DBMS) is a project developed to manage the touring activities of a music band or artist. This system is designed to help organizers, managers, and musicians keep track of tour-related information, such as concert details, venues, expenses, and more. The project is implemented using a combination of SQL for database management, PHP for server-side scripting, and HTML for the user interface.

Features
Concert Management: Record and manage information about upcoming and past concerts, including date, time, venue, and setlist.
Venue Information: Store details about the venues where concerts take place, including address, capacity, and contact information.
Expense Tracking: Keep track of tour-related expenses, such as travel, accommodation, and equipment costs.
Band Members: Maintain a list of band members, their roles, and contact details.
User Authentication: Securely manage user accounts with authentication to control access to the system.

Web server with PHP support (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
MySQL database server
Web browser with JavaScript enabled
